# SQLAlchemy Challenge: Climate Analysis in Hawaii

## Overview

This project involves a climate analysis of Honolulu, Hawaii, using SQLAlchemy to interact with a SQLite database. The analysis focuses on precipitation and temperature data to assist in trip planning. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and a Flask API for serving the data. I was able to create a code with help from ChatGPT as well as working closely with others.
